## [Unreleased]

All additions below are backwards-compatible (new defaulted dataclass
fields only; no existing field or behaviour removed).

### Added

- **Python**: `Material.id` and `SkpModel.materials_by_id` — expose the TLV
  material IDs that `Face.material_id` references, so callers can resolve a
  face's material (colour/transparency) from the public API. Previously the
  join existed only inside the internal exporter.
- **Python**: `Instance.material_id` — the material painted onto a component
  instance itself (SketchUp's "paint the component", the same `D007`/`D107`
  structure faces use). Faces with no material of their own inherit it;
  consumers can now resolve that inheritance like the official SDK does.
- **Python**: texture extraction — `Material.texture` (`Texture` dataclass:
  `filename`, tile `width`/`height` in inches, raw image `data` bytes,
  `save()` helper). Images are read from the material's folder inside the
  embedded ZIP, with a sibling fallback when the stored image name differs
  from `textureFilename`.
- **Python**: colourized materials — `Material.colorized` /
  `colorize_type`, and shared-texture resolution so a colourized copy
  (SketchUp's `[Name]1`, `type="2"`) resolves the image bytes it borrows
  from its source material's folder instead of returning `None`.
- **Python**: per-face texture mapping — `Face.uv_transform` /
  `uv_transform_back` (the 3×3 matrix a positioned / photo-fitted texture
  stores per face; SketchUp's texture pins). Includes the decoded recipe to
  turn it into UVs (plane basis from the normal, then
  `[x, y, 1] @ inv(M) / tile`), calibrated against SDK-exported ground
  truth to < 0.001 UV error, including projective (4-pin distorted)
  mappings.
- **Python**: `Face.back_material_id` — the material of a face's BACK side
  (the `AF0D` child of the face node). A face painted only on its back is
  common when the author paints the visible side of a downward-facing cap;
  without this field such faces looked unpainted.
- **Python**: `Edge.soft` / `smooth` / `hidden` — per-edge display flags
  decoded from the edge's `D307` byte, so viewers/exporters can hide facet
  lines of curved surfaces while keeping author-drawn coplanar edges.
- **Python**: styles — `SkpModel.styles` (`Style`: name, `front_color`,
  `back_color` RGB) parsed from `styles/*/style.xml` (signed-int32 ARGB
  items 4000/4001). Viewers need them to shade unpainted faces the way
  SketchUp does.
- **Python**: `Definition.always_faces_camera` — SketchUp's "always face
  camera" component behavior (2D people / tree cut-outs), decoded from the
  definition's behavior block (`581B` → sub-TLV `5D1B == 1`; its companion
  `5E1B` is "shadows face sun"). Consumers can now render such instances
  as billboards, like SketchUp does.
- **Python**: Image entities — a picture placed in the model as an object
  now parses: its placement wraps a standard instance node inside the
  image-specific `9013`/`401F` containers (previously opaque, so the image
  definition looked "never placed"), and `Definition.is_image` flags the
  single-quad definition backing it (TLV kind `8315 == 2`). Real-world
  case: photo cut-out statues/animals placed as images imported with no
  geometry at all.

### Fixed

- **Python**: entity names (materials, layers, definitions, instances,
  dynamic properties) now decode as **UTF-8** instead of ASCII-with-ignore.
  Dropping the non-ASCII bytes silently corrupted any accented name
  ("cópia" → "cpia", "Diseño" → "Diseo") and — critically — broke the
  material-name join between the TLV stream and the XML material files,
  leaving those materials unresolvable from geometry.
